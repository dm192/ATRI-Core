# ATRI-Core
Concept and Implementation of Real-life ATRI

-------------

~~Believe me, I'm just a fervent ATRI enthusiast~~

Firstly, ever since discovering ATRI, I've been enamored with this character. Being a robot, ATRI at least has some connection to reality. ~~Under the coaxing of a certain mysterious individual~~, I conceived the idea of creating a real-life "True • ATRI".

After much contemplation ~~and late-night ATRI binging~~, I formulated a rough plan for the entire project.

### AI System
The AI system poses one of the more challenging aspects. Imagine a miniaturized mainframe controlling an entire humanoid, managing a variety of sensors and more importantly, its AI, which needs to be even more impressive than ChatGPT-4o and integrated into a single unit. This is quite tricky.

So, I thought of developing a completely new model. While browsing videos on Bilibili, I stumbled upon a concept related to human brain processes. I figured coding this wouldn't be too difficult, using C++ to simulate the human thought process. ~~No surprise, given my high-performance skills, haha~~.

However, in reality, this presents a technical challenge as I'm entirely unfamiliar with C++. But using other languages poses speed issues, so... I'll learn it.

For the logical framework of the system, there's a vague concept: Input information → Extract relevant data for judgment and processing → Query memory based on this information → Pre-process emotional modules → Emulate human brain decision mechanisms → Emotional processing by the module → System control parsing → Control peripheral devices for external output.

### Energy
Currently, the plan is to use miniature controlled nuclear fusion ~~(referred to jokingly as eating and excreting by a certain mysterious individual)~~ to provide energy. This ensures ATRI can last beyond generations, which has its pros and cons.

I don't know much about this yet, except that China's "Sun" (not Liu Cixin's novel, the real one) uses a tokamak device for fusion. Developing this involves significant physics and chemistry challenges. Its mathematical model is like a mini-star, needing to prevent shell meltdown physically and being relatively straightforward chemically.

If achieved, it should last at least 200 years.

### Remote Control (???)
Guess why I had this idea... It's because while browsing Bilibili, I saw Bondo being possessed. This tech isn't as cool in reality as in Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ), so achieving the tech specs will borrow slightly from Elon Musk's brain-computer interface. If you're willing, you could strike a pose like in ZZZ and let ATRI act as your surrogate for any task. But this needs high-speed wireless connectivity!

For technical details: Use WebSocket or high-power UHD connections, though WebSocket may delay over distance and UHD could disconnect. Some artificial satellites use UHD, but ground interference is a major tech challenge.

For this function, plan to use a brain-computer interface for command control and sensory data transfer. Encryption is crucial, planning to deploy a proprietary encryption algorithm + validation.

### Peripherals and Hardware
For peripherals and hardware, the plan mirrors the original, which I won't elaborate on (implementing content from the original isn't difficult, just expensive).
